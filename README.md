Recently working on the freelancing project. It is community website which I have design and build. 
I have design the database table and its relationship and also design UI . The website has normal user and admin user.
Admin can Register their member, Update the member payment and create the Events. But the normal user can see their member status 
and can see list of members and Community activities.

Admin UserName : aviacharya2002@gmail.com
Password : Dharan#123
